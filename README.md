# Material Web Components in React

This uses the `rmwc` package ([Docs](https://rmwc.io)), which is a react wrapper for Google's official `material-components-web` library ([Docs](https://material.io/develop/web)). \
Additionally, this uses the Material icon font from the `material-design-icons-iconfont` package.

Here, the entire `rmwc` library is installed. However, according to the RMWC docs it is recommended to install only the individual components you want to use. (For example: `@rmwc/button`)

## Available Scripts:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode, at [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000). \
The page will reload when you make edits, and any errors will be shown in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder. \
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**NEVER DO THIS.** \
Copies all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies right into your project, so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work. This is a one-way operation!
